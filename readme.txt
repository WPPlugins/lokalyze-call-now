A simple tool that enables your site visitors to call you in one quick, easy step from anywhere on your website using their mobile phones.

== Description ==

**Make it easy for your site visitors to contact you through their mobile phones with click-to-call ability from anywhere on your website during operating hours.**

Click-to-call functionality is automatically tracked as well when you are using Google Analytics.

- click-to-call icon that can be displayed in the top right, top left, bottom right, and bottom left corners of your website.  It can also be displayed across the bottom of your site in mobile devices.
